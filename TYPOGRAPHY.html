Once upon a time there lived a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother had a little red riding hood made for her. Everybody called her <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Little Red Riding Hood</font>.

<font face="courier" size="14" color="green"><u>One day</u></font>, her <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">mother</font> said to her: “Go my dear, and see how your <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">grandmother</font> is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.”

<font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Little Red Riding Hood</font> set out immediately.

As she was going through the <font face="courier" size="14" color="green"><u>wood</u></font>, <font face="courier" size="14" color="red"><sup>she met with a</sup></font> <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font>. <font face="courier" size="14" color="red"><sup>He asked her where she was going.</sup></font>

“I am going to see my <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">grandmother</font>.”

“Does she live far off?” said the <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font>.

“It is <font face="courier" size="14" color="green"><u>beyond that mill</u></font> you see there”.

It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman’s <font face="courier" size="14" color="green"><u>house</u></font>. He knocked at the door.

Tap, tap, tap.

“Who’s there?”

“Your grandchild, <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Little Red Riding Hood</font>,” replied the <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font>, faking her voice.

The good <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">grandmother</font> called out, “Pull the string, and the latch will go up.”

The <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font> pulled the string and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment.

He then shut the door and got into the grandmother’s bed, expecting <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Little Red Riding Hood</font>, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door.

Tap, tap, tap.

“Who’s there?”

“It is your grandchild, <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Little Red Riding Hood</font>.”

The <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font> cried out, “Pull the string, and the latch will go up.”

<font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Little Red Riding Hood</font> pulled the string, and the door opened.
“<font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Grandmother</font>, what big arms you have!”

“All the better to hug you with, my dear.”

“<font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Grandmother</font>, what big ears you have!”

“All the better to hear you with, my child.”

“<font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Grandmother</font>, what big eyes you have!”

“All the better to see you with, my child.”

“<font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">Grandmother</font>, what big teeth you have got!”

“All the better to eat you up with.”

Fortunately, a <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">hunter</font> was passing near by the <font face="courier" size="14" color="green"><u>hut</u></font>. <font face="courier" size="14"color="blue"><sub>He heard the</sub></font> <font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font>, <font face="courier" size="14" color="blue"><sub>and recognised him right away. He ran over to the window. He took a good aim, and that was the end of the</sub></font><font face="courier" size="14" color="violet">wolf</font>.<brS>
