<h1>Sinigang Recipe</h1>
<h2><i>Sinigang is a very famous food originated in the Philippines. It is a stew or soup that is sour.</i>><h2>
<h3>Other country also have other food similar to our <strong>Sinigang</strong> like Vietnam's Cahn Chua. It is also a stew and also uses tamarind to make the soup sour.</h3>
<p>Vietnam's Cahn Chua also uses pineapple to make the soup sour aside from tamarind. It also uses more fish than pork.</p>
<p><strong>Sinigang</strong> on the other hand, uses tamarind and tomatoes to make the soup sour. The recipes in cooking <strong>Sinigan</strong> uses meat and fish.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Baboy</h3>
<p><font color="black">This type or version of <strong>sinigang</strong> is one of the most known <strong>sinigang</strong> versions. It is just like the other <strong>sinigang</strong> but it uses pork combined with different vegetables like okra, radish and eggplant.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Bangus</h3>
<p><font color="black">This <strong>sinigang</strong> is like the first one but it uses fish. I think this version is much faster to cook since fish are more faster to cook than the pork.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Manok</h3>
<p><font color="black"><strong>Sinigang na Manok</strong> is just like the <strong>Sinigang</strong> na Baboy. You will just change the meat that you will be using. The ingredients for <strong>Sinigang</strong> na Baboy and <strong>Sinigang</strong> na Manok are pretty much the same. They will differ in terms of time of cooking because it takes time to make the pork soft.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Tilapia</h3>
<p><font color="black">Also like the other <strong>sinigang</strong> mentioned earlier, this version is pretty much the same except that this recipe uses ginger. Other vegetables are optional.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Lapu-Lapu</h3>
<p><font color="black">It is also just like the other <strong>sinigang</strong> but this recipe uses lapu-lapu.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang sa Miso</h3>
<p><font color ="black">This version uses fish, commonly salmon heads. Fermented soybean with barley or miso is added in the soup so it is called <strong>sinigang</strong> sa miso.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Salmon Belly</h3>
<p><font color="black">This recipe uses salmon belly but the procedures and ingredients are pretty much the same. This recipe is mostly in a restaurants's menu.</p>
<h3 style="color: red;">Sinigang na Hipon</h3>
<p><font color="black">Again, this version is like the others. It is also one of the famous dishes in a filipino restaurant.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sinigang na Manok</h3>
<p><strong>Sinigang</strong> na Manok is commonly cooked by the Filipinos because of its taste and it is easy to cook.</p>
