<li>Quadratic Equation
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>-It is amathematical sentence of degree 2 that can be
written in the following standard form. ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='2'>
<li>Quadratic Inequalities
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>-It is a statement that contains a polynomial of second degree which can be written in any of the following forms: ax^2 + bx + c < 0 ax^2 + bx + c > 0 ax^2 + bx + c ≤ 0 ax^2 + bx + c ≥ 0.
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='3'>
<li>General Form of Quadratic Function
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>-the general form of quadratic function is f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers, a ≠ 0.
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='4'>
<li>Standard Form of Vertex Form
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>f(x) = a(x − h)^2 + k, called the vertex form, where a ≠ 0, and the point (h, k) is called the vertex.
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='5'>
<li>Graph of Quadratic Funtion
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>-It is called parabola which can be described as trajectories of a bouncing ball. It is incorporated into structures
like the parabolic reflectors that form the base of the satellite dishes and the headlights of cars.

</dd>
<ol type='1' start='2'>
<li>Nuclear Fusion
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Nuclear fusion is the process during which atomic nuclei are forced together under tremendous heat and pressure to create heavier nuclei.
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='3'>
<li>How Stars Are Formed
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>A typical star begins as a thin cloud of hydrogen gas that, under the force of gravity, collects into a huge, dense sphere.
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='4'>
<li>Nucleosynthesis
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>‘Nucleo-‘ means ‘to do with nuclei’; ‘synthesis’ means ‘to make’, so nucleosynthesis is the creation of (new) atomic nuclei
</dd>
<ol type='1' start='5'>
<li>Alpha Process
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The alpha process, also known as the alpha ladder, is one of two classes of nuclear fusion reactions by which stars convert helium into heavier elements, the other being the triple-alpha process.
