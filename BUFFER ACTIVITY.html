<br><b>New York CNN Business —</b> Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has “threatened” to pull Twitter from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion.<br>
<br><i>“Apple (AAPL) has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why,”</i> Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple (AAPL) and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter’s business.<br>
<br>In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter.<i> “Do they hate free speech in America,” </i>he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the platform. <i>“What’s going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?” Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also criticized Apple’s size, claimed it engages in “censorship,”</i> and <u>called out</u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store.<br>
<br>In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know <i>“Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?” </i>In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward<i> “pay 30%,” </i>the other pointed toward “go to war.” An old car labeled “Elon” skidded toward the latter.
